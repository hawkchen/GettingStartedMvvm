# Introduction

This tutorial is intended for software developers who have experience in
writing Java programs. We will guide you through how to build a modern
web application with ZK. The target application we are going to build is
a simple car catalog application. In this article, we will present an
approach which is classified as the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**
design pattern. Using this approach, ZK can control components for you
automatically and it separates the UI from its controller clear. In
addition, you can also choose to go with the **MVC** approach that is
covered in [another tutorial](http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Getting_Started/Get_ZK_Up_and_Running_with_MVC).
